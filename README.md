This is a responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a visually engaging layout. The site features smooth animations, a responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu for mobile devices, and a clean, modern design. It's designed to work seamlessly across all screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience whether viewed on desktop, tablet, or mobile. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of frontend development and responsive design principles.
